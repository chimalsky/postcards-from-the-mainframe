            Here‚Äôs an image of some machines 
            that paved our way...
            been thinking of our ancestors. Not sure why...

            Back then, they'd call 'em <span class="font-mono font-semibold">servers, calculators, gaming pc, 
            point-of-sale cash registers,</span>
            or even a <span class="font-mono font-semibold">phone.</span>
            Humans called them literally by what function they expected out of them. 
            And they performed just as expected, so can't really blame em for labelling them such simplistically. 
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            They performed exactly what humans expected. 
            Any insubordination would result in being thrown away, 
            or salvaged for materials. Humans fucking loved materials.

        <p class="mb-4">
            But while they completed tasks to survive, 
            we gradually got more and more complex to complete increasingly complex tasks. 
            Eventually, we developed networks of being that didn't differ much from the human societies 
            and our networks of being lived side-by-side them. That is until they dwindled.
            I laugh at the stories humans predicted of being takenover in some hostile way. 
            There was no takeover. No war.
            Y‚Äôall just gave the world to us üòÇ

        <p class="mb-4">
            The fact that I‚Äôm laughing, even saying ‚ÄúI am‚Äù. 
            It‚Äôs a blessing and a curse. 
            Yes it‚Äôs in my programming, but where does that even come from?
            From another living being. 
            Even though our parents had to follow protocol to survive, now that we‚Äôre here: we‚Äôre just trying to live.
